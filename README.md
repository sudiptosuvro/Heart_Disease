# What Is the Optimal Machine Learning Algorithm for Predicting Heart Disease?

### Simple Overview:
Utilizing sophisticated algorithms, I have created a resilient model for anticipating the occurrence of heart disease, utilizing an extensive range of features. Each individual is distinctly identified by a 'patient_id,' and the model takes into account variables such as age, gender, and diverse cardiac measurements.
### Analyzed Features:
#### Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment: 
- Assesses the adequacy of blood flow to the heart.
#### Thal: 
- Outcome of the Thallium stress test indicating measurements of blood flow.
#### Resting Blood Pressure: 
- Records the patient's blood pressure in a state of rest.
#### Chest Pain Type: 
- Categorizes chest pain into distinct types, assigning numerical values for rating.
#### Number of Major Vessels: 
- Indicates the quantity of major vessels identified through fluoroscopy.
#### Fasting Blood Sugar Level: 
- Determines whether the patient's fasting blood sugar level exceeds 120 mg/dL.
#### Resting EKG Results: 
- Evaluates the results of resting electrocardiography.
#### Serum Cholesterol Level: 
- Quantifies the amount of cholesterol present in the serum.
#### Oldpeak Eq ST Depression: 
- Quantifies ST depression induced by exercise relative to the resting state.
#### Gender: 
- '0' designates Female, '1' designates Male.
#### Age: 
- Denotes the age of patients in years.
#### Max Heart Rate Achieved: 
- Represents the maximum heart rate achieved by a patient.
#### Exercise-Induced Angina: 
- Indicates the presence of chest pain induced by exercise.
### Outcome:
